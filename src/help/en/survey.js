          When users test a Quant-UX prototype, the user input is saved. For instance, a Star Rating that they are giving is stored.
          You can use this mechanism to also collect qualitative feedback from the users.
          <br>
          You can see the survey answers in the "Dashboard" section.

             To create a survey in your prototype, simply use the normal input elements, such as Star Ratings or input boxes. You have to
             create a data binding for every element that you want to be visible in the survey section. To create for
             instance a Star Rating at the end of the test follow these steps:

             <ol>
                <li>
                    Add a new screen to your prototype, and link it such as it is the last screen in the flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a Star Rating element to the screen
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the new element
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the 'Prototype' view
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the 'Survey Element' checkbox.
                </li>
              </ol>
