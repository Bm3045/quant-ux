            Screen Segments allow you to embed a screen in another screen, for instance to allow
            vertical or horizontal scrolling. To create a screen segment perform the following steps:
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create a screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Press <strong>W</strong> to open the widget menu and select the <strong>Screen Segment</strong>
                        widget. Place it on the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a second screen and select it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the <strong>Segment</strong> Checkbox. You can now resize the screen freely to match the
                        dimensions of the Screen Segment widget. A larger size will result in a scroll behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the Screen Segment widget. In the properties section, click 
                        on the <strong>Select Screen Segment</strong> option. A dialog will show up, listing all the
                        segment screens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the second screen and press save.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <br>
